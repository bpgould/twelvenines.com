## Welcome to Twelve Nines

The name comes from AWS S3's famous durability guarantee: **11 nines** (99.999999999%). If you store 10 million objects for 10,000 years, you might statistically lose one.

This site *aspires* to one better: **12 nines** (99.9999999999%) of availability - roughly 1 second of downtime every 32 years.
