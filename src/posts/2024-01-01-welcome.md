Welcome to the inaugural post on Twelve Nines! This site aims to be an example of reliability and simplicity.

## What is Twelve Nines?

"Twelve nines" refers to 99.9999999999% uptime - an aspirational goal that represents near-perfect availability. While this level of reliability is rarely achievable (or necessary) in practice, it serves as a reminder to build robust and reliable systems.

## About This Site

This static website is built using:

- **[Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/)** - A fast, flexible static site generator written in Rust
- **GitHub Pages** - For reliable, free hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - For automated builds and deployments
- **AWS Route 53** - For DNS management with the custom domain

## Why Static Sites?

Static sites offer several advantages:

- **Performance**: No server-side processing means fast page loads
- **Security**: No database or server-side code means fewer attack vectors
- **Reliability**: Simple architecture with fewer points of failure
- **Cost**: Can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

If you want to build something similar, check out the [setup guide](https://github.com/bgould/twelvenines.com/blob/main/SETUP.md) in the repository.

Happy building!
